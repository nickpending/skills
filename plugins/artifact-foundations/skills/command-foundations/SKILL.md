# command-foundations

Reference content for building Claude Code slash commands.

## content routing

| intent | load |
|--------|------|
| structure, frontmatter, syntax, format | `structure.md` |
| archetype, pattern, which type, decision | `archetypes.md` |
| minimal example | `exemplar-minimal.md` |
| priming example | `exemplar-priming.md` |
| workflow example | `exemplar-workflow.md` |
| orchestration example | `exemplar-orchestration.md` |
| full command context | all files |

## defaults

- archetype: start with `archetypes.md` to pick pattern
- structure: always read `structure.md` for universal rules
- exemplar: read ONE relevant exemplar, not all
