# Validate Skill

Check if a skill follows the canonical structure.

## Step 1: Read Target Skill

READ the skill's SKILL.md and directory contents.

## Step 2: Check Structure

Validate against skill-foundations structure requirements.

## Step 3: Check Body Pattern

Validate against skill-foundations archetype patterns.

## Step 4: Check Prompt Quality

Validate against prompt-foundations principles checklist with skill-specific context:
- Roles are rarely needed — skills inject procedures/knowledge, not identity
- Skills load into existing context with established identity

## Step 5: Report

**COMPLIANT** if all checks pass.

**NON-COMPLIANT** if any check fails:
- LIST specific failures with location
- SUGGEST fixes
- ASK if user wants automated fixes
